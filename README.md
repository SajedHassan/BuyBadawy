Conceptual Design: The main idea of the app. is to be the chain link between a Bedouin seller and any buyer. It acts as an online Bedouin market. It aims to:
• Refresh the Bedouin industry.
• Preserve the Bedouin’s Hand Crafts.
• Offer jobs.
• Reviving the Bedouin culture’s icon.
• Documenting the culture in the process.
• Encourage Bedouins to fancy the idea of sharing.
• Offers means to earn living.
It targets:
• Sellers: Bedouins + Corporates.
• Buyers: From both inside or outside the Bedouin Community.
The flow:
• The seller offers his product for sale at a reasonable price.
• Buyer searches for the required product and sees the seller’s product in the suitable category.
• The buyer is provided with detailed description for the productand is able to contact the seller through the given contact information.

In the internship, only a design and prototype was required.
Our team has been working on making the project a reality ever since.
